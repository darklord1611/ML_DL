### Overview

- data drift -> data not in standard conditions
- proof of concept -> production gap (POC)
- ML production cycle:
  - scoping -> define projects
  - data -> define data, establish baseline, label and organize data
  - modeling -> select and train data, perform error analysis
  - deployment -> deploy in production, monitor & maintain system
- consist of many iterations between step 2-3-4
