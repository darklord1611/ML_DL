## Machine Learning
- What is ML? a field of study that makes computer learn without being explicitly programmed
- ML is a sub-field of AI
- application? self-driving cars, payment fraud, healthcare, speech recognition, .....
- ultimate purpose? AGI(Artificial General Intelligence) perfoms at a human-like level
    - How? through learning algorithms
- ML algorithms
    - Supervised learning: widely used in real-life applications
    - Unsupervised learning
    - Recommender systems
    - Reinforcement learning
- Course also focus on practical advice on how to apply, when to apply different algorithms

### Supervised Learning
- map input x -> output label y
- learning algorithms include a set of examples + with the **right answer**
    - input: email, output: spam? -> spam filtering
    - input: English, output: Spanish -> machine translation
    - input: advertisements, user info, output: click? -> online advertising
- after training, take completely new input x -> produce y
- given a set of data points, figure out the appropriate line, curve, ... to fit most of them
- types of algorithms:
    - regression: predicting a real number(given the daily market data, predict the Bitcoin price)
    - classification: predicting a discrete number(class/category) (given the weight and height of a football player, determine his/her position) 
- boundary lines: lines that separate alike groups of data points
