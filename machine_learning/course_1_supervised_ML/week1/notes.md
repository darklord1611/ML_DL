## Machine Learning
- What is ML? a field of study that makes computer learn without being explicitly programmed
- ML is a sub-field of AI
- application? self-driving cars, payment fraud, healthcare, speech recognition, .....
- ultimate purpose? AGI(Artificial General Intelligence) perfoms at a human-like level
    - How? through learning algorithms
- ML algorithms
    - Supervised learning: widely used in real-life applications
    - Unsupervised learning
    - Recommender systems
    - Reinforcement learning
- Course also focus on practical advice on how to apply, when to apply different algorithms
