# Some Insights
- If two distributions are the same then we can swap values between data points without affect the average -> random permutation

- large p-value would support the alternative hypothesis
- Numerical data can be sorted in increasing or decreasing order. Thus the values of a numerical data set have a rank order. A **percentile** is the value at a particular rank.
- if your score on a test is on the 95th percentile, a common interpretation is that only 5% of the scores were higher than yours.

- WTF is confidence interval? Suppose you want to find the mean height of European football players -> How? We can't calculate the entire population -> draw a sample, and calculate the mean of the sample instead? -> Problems? One sample may not be representative enough -> draw several samples, each sample could have a different mean -> we need to find a range of values with high probability of being the real mean of the population -> confidence interval

- Variance? -> mean squared deviation
- We want variance to be the same unit as values -> take the root of mean squared deviation -> standard deviation
- Convert to standard units: z = (value - deviation) / average

- How does sample size affects confidence interval? Larger sample size -> less variance, reduced standard error, aka narrower confidence interval -> better parameter estimate
- For normally distributed variables, the interval “center +- 2 SDs” contains 95% of the data.
- Maximum SD of a population of zeroes and ones is 0.5.
